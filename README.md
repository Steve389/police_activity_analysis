# police_activity_analysis


In this project, I will analyse data from the Stanford Open Policing dataset . 
The dataset is relative to police stops and  contains data for every US state; however, in this particular project, I will be focusing only on the RI (Rode Island) data.

My analysis will focus on the following main factors:

- gender (traffic violations, search rate, protective frisks across gender)
- time (hourly arrest rate, drugs related stops over time)
- area (violations by district)
- weather (impact of weather conditions on police activity)

The main purpose of this project is to try to answer questions by finding possible correlations between data features; however, 
there is no underlying assumption that correlation equals to causation, as this would have to be proved with more data.
